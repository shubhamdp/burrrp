      <content type="html" xml:base="https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/ashtavinayak-pilgrimage-on-bike">&lt;p&gt;637 km, 8 places, 2 days, and 1 Yamaha FZs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drove on highways, raw roads, and roads full of potholes, through the most scenic ghats in Sahyadri, Malshej, and Tamhini. I was driving in rain, and fog, with sheer visibility of few meters, dark roads, but sometimes the Surya Dev flickered the rays of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been three years now that I had been dreaming/planning to do this. I started pinning and planning the route for a trip in April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashtavinayak; Ashta means Eight, and Vinayak is one of the names of Shri Ganpati. These temples are considered the eight most holy places in Maharashtra. They are all situated around Pune, and each temple has a unique architecture and idol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shree Chintamani, Theur&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shree Mayureshwar, Morgaon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shree Siddhivinayak, Siddhatek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shree Mahaganapati, Ranjangaon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shree Vighnahar Ganapati, Ozar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shree Girijatmaj, Lenyadri&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shree Varadvinayak, Mahad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shree Ballaleshwar, Pali&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1e4SwWIpbn7SRKG-aXonCQ51XJ15sA0Wx&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ehbc=2E312F&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was a long weekend (13th, 14th, and 15th of August) due to a holiday on Indian Independence day. I was confused about whether to visit Varanasi or go on the Ashtavinayak bike trip. But, money matters üòÖ, and I hopped on a bike to fulfill the long pending desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started preparing for the trip by collecting the necessary items like rain covers, ropes to tie the luggage, a good helmet, and riding gloves, and preparing mentally to saddle approx. 300 km per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked a few friends if they would like to join, but none cared, wished me luck, and asked to bring back Prasad üôÅ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximate distances&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/burrrp/assets/images/screenshot-2022-08-04-at-23.28.34.png&quot; alt=&quot;map with distances&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday-13th-august-2022&quot;&gt;Saturday 13th August 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;theur&quot;&gt;Theur&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started from home around 7:30 AM towards Theur and Reached around 9:00 AM. I bought Prasad and Flower from the Ajji near temple, and she looked after my bike and luggage. This is what I basically did at every place. Temple was not crowded at that time of day, so it was easy to get in. I took the Bappa‚Äôs blessing and spent some time in the serenity of the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;morgaon&quot;&gt;Morgaon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reached Morgaon around 11.00 AM. It was pretty crowded, took me around one and half hours to take the blessings. People were enjoying by singing Ganapati aarti, songs. Kids enjoyed strolling in the queues. Temple has pretty good wood carvings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;siddhitek&quot;&gt;Siddhitek&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reached around 2.00 PM. No queue walked in and out of the temple in no time. Like most other Ashtavinayak temples this one is also carved in stone. Temple is situated near the banks of the Bhima river. The view from the bridge was astounding as the river was coursing in full swing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ranjangaon&quot;&gt;Ranjangaon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reached around 4.30 PM. It rained for some time during the ride. While riding toward Ranjangaon, I was blown by the lush greenery. Since this is on the Pune-Nagar highway, you‚Äôd find this place mostly crowded. It took me around one and half hours in the darshan queue. I chatted with a few around me, and they were also on the Ashtavinayak pilgrimage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to stay in Narayangaon for the night. It is approx. 60 km from Ranjangaon and 15 km from Ozar(next temple on my route). I left for Narayangao around 7:00 PM. Roads are not that good, most were work in progress. It took around two hours to reach Narayangaon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday-14th-august-2022&quot;&gt;Sunday 14th August 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left around 6:30 AM towards Ozar, roads were pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ozar&quot;&gt;Ozar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reached around 7:00 AM; temples were pretty crowded in the early morning. It is situated on the banks of the Kukadi river, and the views around the temple were pretty amazing. It took around an hour to get in and out of the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lenyadri&quot;&gt;Lenyadri&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roads from Lenyandri to Ozar is quiet scenic. Lenyandri means mountain caves, and Shree Ganapati is situated at some height here. One has to climb¬†&lt;strong&gt;283 steps&lt;/strong&gt;¬†carved out of stone. The shrine here is a rock-cut cave at the entrance of which are eight pillars with carvings of elephants and lions. Views from the top are really amazing. You‚Äôll come across a lot of monkeys here. They just sit around and take the eating items from the people and stuff them inside their jaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mahad&quot;&gt;Mahad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Lendyandri, I left towards Mahad. It was a long ride but, the best part was the route, it goes through the mighty Malshej ghats. One can easily take down the eyes from the roads to look around the majestic greenery and the waterfall. It can make anyone spellbound. Some roads were good, and some were bad. For 20-30 km I had to drive in very foggy weather, with visibility close to 5 meters. One would just drive with instinct and lights.&lt;br /&gt;
I reached Mahad around 4.00 PM, and it was crowded, it took around two hours to take the blessings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pali&quot;&gt;Pali&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, I left for Pali. It took me around one and half hours through the traffic and bad roads. Reached around 6:30 PM. Temple was not crowed. I was out by 7:00 PM and started preparing for the ride back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was driving back through the mighty Tamhini ghats in the night, it was raining lightly, sometimes heavily. Fog would reduce the visibility to a few meters. I was following a few cars, whose lights would warn me of turns and incoming vehicles. When they get fast I was on my own, driving like maniac in the dark nights, slowly, looking for the corners. But, it was a worthy experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was back home by 11:00 PM and that was the end of my ride.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/time-machine">&lt;p&gt;On weekends, I prefer wandering the outskirts of the city, staring at the sunset, sunrises, cool skies. But in these difficult times, it‚Äôs kinda impossible. So, I use this ‚Äútime machine‚Äù, &lt;strong&gt;Google Photos&lt;/strong&gt;, to take a dig down the memory lane, relieving the sunsets, sunrises, the woods in the outskirts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes lost on the bicycle try to find the way home, I only remember the moments in journey, I never really cared about thet destination. Cause I have to make it to the home anyway üòú.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memories made, the laughter, the giggles, the fun, oh how can one forget the adventure. Little breakthroughs, its celebrations, sad moments, setbacks(though we hardly capture the sad moments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staring at the photo and remembering the story that picture is telling you. Still scrolling down the photos going back in time, a year back, 2 years back, and so on till you hit the bottom of few thousand photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every picture or set of pictures tells a story. It has the prologue, the main story, and the epilogue. Sorry for the bookish description, FYI, I don‚Äôt read a lot. Since its not a dream you do remember how you came to that place. By the way, in dreams you do not remember how you enter the place. The conversation you had or the breathtaking scenery you enjoyed or the incidents occurred, memories created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know what you just did, you relived the moment in your past. You took yourself back in time, had the same conversation, or relished the moment and came back to normal time. I hope you were smiling or blushing when you were in there or enjoying the cool breeze on your face or the raindrops thrashing your face when you were hiking in rain. A late-night walk and talk with the close friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, if I have to describe it, I would say I just experienced time travel. Although, I could not correct the mistakes I have made in the past, or change things the way I want to. But why to regret it, because you wanted it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theodore Roosevelt once said, ‚ÄúI am part of everything I read.‚Äù So these are your pictures, your memories and you were part of it. Sorry, you still are part of it. Since¬†you have time in this lockdown,¬†take a moment and relive it, AGAIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Google Photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Home, Stay Safe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/paper-towns</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/paper-towns">&lt;p&gt;Quentin, Q, lives across the street to Margo. He is infatuated with her since she moved into the neighborhood. They used to play together in their childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fine evening, Q and Margo were headed to Jefferson Park riding a bicycle. They were blown by a dead body attached to the tree. When Q took two steps back, at the same time she moved two steps forward. This shows Q was shit scared and Margo a brave girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night Margo climbs Q‚Äôs window and told him about her findings after a day-long investigation regarding the dead body. Rather focusing on her words he was innocently staring at her beautiful face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life goes on, school, home, blah blah blah‚Ä¶ but his crush remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margo was a cool kid who planned pranks on/with friends, likes to roam around. Along with friends, she once wrapped the neighborhood with toilet paper. Do you feel the intensity of how adventurous is she?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Q was the silent, unassertive guy. He liked to play Resurrection along with his friends Ben (‚ÄúBenjamin‚Äù) and Radar (‚ÄúMarcus‚Äù).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly after nine years, Margo again climbs through the same window and takes Q with her on an adventure. Q did not know that this night is gonna change him, the way he thinks about her, the way he looked at life. He was going to do a shit load of adventurous stuff. She had planned eleven pranks which they will be pulling on her friends. She wanted to take revenge from her ex-boyfriend and best-friend who cheated on her. They carried eight of her pranks. Then she asked Q if he had someone in mind with whom they can pull the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pranks were mostly breaking and entering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tenth, they enter the highest building in the Town. They stare at the town from the top of the building, view is just amazing. She calls this view a paper town and says ‚ÄúThings look beautiful from the distance, but when we get close to it looks worst‚Äù. She relates this to herself like how her friends are drifting away as they are getting to know her better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they leave for the last one, to break into the SeaWorld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time in the lifetime Q has spent such a bold night. He thinks that he may spend time with her from tomorrow. He builds the thoughts on what to speak with her when she arrives and many more. But she did not show up at the school. She goes missing.¬† She left the home. This is not the first time she left home without informing anyone. But she always left a clue where she was going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even this time she left the clues. This time she left the trail of clues for Quentin. Can he prove his love by finding her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will he be able to solve the clues, the treasure hunt? What if these clues take him to the dead ends? Even if he finds her, does she really left the clues for him? Can he convince her to come back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, why did she even left?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of unknowns, but I would say, written like a drama, but filled with mystery, a boy on an adventure to find his girl and to get answers to a few questions!!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/me-before-you">&lt;p&gt;Me Before You&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had nothing in common until love gave them everything to lose‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louisa Clark knows how many steps are there between her home and the bus stop. The chatty girl works at Buttered Bun Cafe. She could suggest you the perfect calorie count cupcake. An ordinary girl living an exceedingly ordinary life. Steady boyfriend, close family, who has barely been farther than their tiny village. She takes a badly needed job working for Will Traynor, who is wheelchair bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge life, big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travel and now he‚Äôs pretty sure he cannot live the way he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will is acerbic, moody, bossy, but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They start spending time together. They make fun of each other, talks witty. She shaves his beard and trims his hair. Cleaned shaved Will looks handsome. If it wouldn‚Äôt have been a wheelchair there would be ton of girls stalking him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lou plans an outing at racecourse along with Nathan but this fails miserably. Will and Lou attends a musical concert where She dresses in the perfect red gown and man she looks staggeringly beautiful. Anyone will be dumbfounded and Will is not an exception. Lou even accompanies Will to Alicia‚Äôs wedding. They both enjoy the music and drinks and guess what, when everyone starts to dance, Lou asks Will to give her a whirl. She sits in his lap and Will moves his chair towards the dance floor and he gives a whirl. Everyone gets surprised, even Alicia. These are the best days of Will since his accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book made me fall in love with Louisa. Its a life of two people who couldn‚Äôt have less in common, a heart breaking romantic novel that asks, What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;li&gt;Do take advice but from the ones who know about it. (eg: about brickmaking take advice from brickman)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investment will make babies and you will also want babies should make babies. So do not waste the returns reinvest them.&lt;/li&gt;

Invest in only places where the principal is safe, where it may be reclaimed and where you may not fail to collect the rental. Consult a wise man, let the wisdom guard your treasure.&lt;/li&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/the-notebookmovie">&lt;p&gt;‚ÄòThe Notebook‚Äô is a romantic drama based on the novel ‚ÄòThe Notebook‚Äô by Nicolas Sparks. Noah is played by Ryan Gosling and Allie by Rachel McAdams. The Movie starts with an elderly man at old age home, he reads a love story to his fellow patient who has lost her memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWill you dance with me?‚Äù, Noah asks Allie when he sees her at the fair for the very first time. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù from Allie could not stop him from trying one more time. When Noah attempts a daredevil stunt of hanging to ferry wheel, she agrees to go out with him. She says just to escape from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fin‚Äôs girlfriend, Sarah, is a good friend of Allie. Fin is Noah‚Äôs friend at work. Fin and Sarah invite Allie to the movie and she did not expect to see Noah there. After the movie Fin and Sarah take a car ride home. Noah and Allie decide to walk and there you go‚Ä¶.another love story started with a walk !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah is the laborer at Lumberyard, a sawmill, and Allie is a rich kid. Allie was enjoying something different from her daily routine, she was having fun with Noah. They were really enjoying the good time until Allie‚Äôs family thinks of an intervention. They move to New York for Allie‚Äôs higher studies. Noah, for a year, writes to Allie every single day and Allie‚Äôs mother make sure that those letters do not reach Allie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Noah and Fin join the Army to serve in World War II. Allie pursues her nursing and serves in a hospital filled with soldiers injured in war. There she met a wounded soldier, Lon, who asks her out. Lon and Allie fall in love and after spending some time together they decide to get married. After Returning from the war, Noah starts to build the house of his dreams. Few days before the wedding Allie sees a photograph of Noah with the house in a newspaper and she decides to meet him by seeking permission from Lon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story of young love, separation, another love, and dilemma. I liked the movie, do give it a try to know what happens further, whether Allie chooses Lon or Noah.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2019-02-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/my-journey-to-harishchandragad</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/my-journey-to-harishchandragad">&lt;p&gt;We planned, packed our bags and en routed to Pachnai, one of the base villages to reach the top of Harishchandragad . Harishchandragad is one of the well known forts for camping in Ahmadnagar district. Harishchandragad is situated at 1422 meters from sea level. One can reach Harishchandragad top via three routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pachnai, easiest one, takes around 2 Hrs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Khireshwar, easiest but takes around 4 Hrs to hike to the top&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nalichi vaat, this one is the hardest, has some rocky patches and require the assistance of ropes and safety harness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attractions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kokan Kada: It is a curved cliff, from here onward Kokan region starts. This is where all the hikers set up their tents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
¬†
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kedareshwar Temple and caves: Temple of Lord Shiva, this temple has sources of fresh water which is available all year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taramati Peak: It is the highest point on Harishchandragad and one can experience sunrise and sunset from here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our journey:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; After hiking Rajgad, we knew the fitness level of the weakest member in our company, hence we chose the easiest route, via Pachnai. Zoomcar seemed to be the most convenient option to reach Pachnai. We started at 9 a.m. from Pune on Saturday morning and reached Pachnai by 3 p.m. We had a light breakfast in the morning, our stomachs were craving for anything available at the earliest and Bhurji Paav served as a hunger savior. We started hiking the trail around 3.15 p.m, it is quite an easy trail to hike. We reached Kokan Kada in 2 Hrs. Kokan Kada is one of the main attractionS on Harishchandragad fort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met an elderly man on the way towards Kokan Kada. He told us that his son runs the hotel at Kokan Kada. On reaching Kokan Kada we alighted our backpacks in his hut. As we wanted to experience sunset from Mt. Taramati, we left in no time. It took 1 Hr to reach Taramati Peak. We did not know the exact route to the peak, we lost trail when we reached the half distance. But we made it in time to the peak when sun was just setting. The golden orange hues, Bhandardara lake, the widespread mountain range and the setting sun, it was breathtaking. One could not look away from the beautiful sunset. We sat for 10-15 min just to enjoy the dawn and hues. Time to descent Mt. Taramati, it was getting darker, we had only two torches to accommodate 5 people, but luckily we were blessed with the bright moonlight. On the way down from Mt. Taramati, we lost trail once again. But after some hindrance we made it to the Kokan Kada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set up tent swiftly and washed our hands as we were famished due to the adventure. We had Aloo Matki and Bajri Bhakri in dinner, anything would have tasted great at that point of time. After dinner, we lighted the bonfire and sat around it. The warmth from that bonfire was much needed in that chilling cold. We sat discussing A number of topics, making fun of each other and deciding the next camping location. Early morning some groups left for Mt. Taramati for experiencing the sunrise and we were in tents sleeping, trying to escape the chilling cold. We had a light breakfast, unset our tents and packed our bags and started return journey towards Pachnai. Descending the trail is easier so, we were at the base in 1 and half hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an unforgettable experience, sunset, sunrise, bhandardara lake, bonfire and freezing wind near Kokan Kada. I would love to hike this top once more. I don‚Äôt know whoever said that ‚Äúadventure fills your soul‚Äù, I think I just validated it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/pari">&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGo back home‚Äù, Saboor shouting at Abdull. Saboor and Pari, his daughter, were on their way to Kabul. Abdull was very close to his 3 years old sister. After all, he was the one who was looking after her since their mother passed away a year ago. Their stepmother was busy looking after her kids. Abdull was 10. Saboor started throwing stones at Abdull, but he was dodging it and did not give up. Finally, he convinced his father and joined them on the journey to Kabul. The journey would take 2 days by foot from Shahbagh. They rested near a cave that night and had dinner. Next day early morning they were moving. Nabi, Saboor‚Äôs brother-in-law, was waiting for them near the Kabul‚Äôs shoe market. He took them to his owner‚Äôs house. Saboor married Nabi‚Äôs sister after his first wife died due to typhoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Wahdati, owners were having trouble conceiving a child. A few days ago Mrs. Wahdati asked Nabi to take her to Shahbagh. There he introduced her to his sister‚Äôs family. Saboor used to work on construction site on daily wages. But the war between the Afghan government and the Mujahideen took away his family‚Äôs bread and butter. He was having a difficult time finding a new job. Mrs. Wahdati was enchanted by the cute Pari. Nabi noticed how she was interacting with little Pari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back Mrs. Wahdati was sobbing in the backseat. Nabi felt bad, he knew the reasons. When they arrived in Kabul, Nabi suggested them to buy Pari, he said he would talk with Saboor. They thought about it and agreed. Saboor was struggling to find employment so he agreed to it. To feed the family he decided to sacrifice Pari. Saboor knew the intensity of the bond between Pari and Abdull, that‚Äôs why he was hesitating to take Abdull with him. He knew that Abdull would be alone without Pari. But considering that this would be the last few moments he would be spending with Pari, he agreed to take him to Kabul. 20 years later‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abdull was blessed with a girl child. How could he not name her Pari? He told the story of selling Pari to his wife and Pari. Pari used to look at other children in her neighborhood who had siblings to play with. So, Pari considered that she has a twin sister Pari, who looked exactly like her. Pari‚Äôs sister was present everywhere with her. She was only visible to her. Abdull used to tell her bedtime story and when he left the room thinking she is asleep, she used to put on an extra pillow beside her pillow and go to sleep saying goodbye to her twin sister Pari. Her bond with Pari was out of the world, that no body could understand, not even Abdull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story is extracted from ‚ÄòAnd the mountains echoed‚Äô novel by Khaled Hosseini. Back in 1950‚Äôs, due to extreme poverty in Afghanistan, poor families were selling their kids to rich families. Unknowingly kids were sacrificed to feed the remaining family. This was good for the kid‚Äôs future, they would grow in better environment, good food, education rather than struggling for daily wages.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://shubhamdp.github.io/burrrp/magic-potion">&lt;p&gt;There lived a man named Aayub in a village named Gul Daman. He was very hard working. He married a beautiful woman named Mariam and they were blessed with 3 boys and 2 girls. Out of the five children, he was very fond of the youngest one, Qais. Everything was fantastic, but as the day follows night, Aayub‚Äôs bad time was close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a demon, A monstrous one, who used to visit villages and take away a child from each village. Sadly, he caught Aayub and Aayub had to decide whether he wanted to give one of his children or if he fights the demon he would lose all five. He has time till morning. Then after discussing this with his wife they agreed on drawing a chit. Unlucky for Aayub, Qais was the word on the drawn chit. With a heavy heart he called Qais. Qais had no idea what was going on. He jumped happily towards Aayub. He took Qais outside the home and left him there and closed the door. Qais banged the door with all the force he could gather. Aayub cried helplessly. The demon appeared and took Qais far away towards the mountains where nobody would dare visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aayub, his wife and kids were in agony. Everyone back in the village named Aayub a coward. Even he thought the same, but his wife consoled him. Aayub, tired of hearing bad words from villagers, decided to fight the demon. He packed his dagger, food for his trip and started walking towards the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aayub had decided to walk the tough journey, he did not even know where and how far the demon lived how many days WOULD his food last. But finally, he made it. He started throwing stones at the demon‚Äôs door. The demon asked him why was he there? He said that he came to take his son back home. The demon asked him to enter the room. With no choice left, he followed the demon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demon drew the curtain and on a glass wall, Aayub could see his son. Qais seemed happy, he was playing with a few other kids. Aayub shouted with his name but it was of no use, Qais was unaware of the things on the other side of the glass. The demon gave some time to Aayub and asked him to decide whether he wanted to see HIS son happy, get well educated or take him with back to the village. He was again at the hot seat. After thinking for a while and looking at his son for the last time, he started walking towards home. The demon said that he had made the right choice, but only a father would know a loss of the son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demon handed Aayub a magic potion and told to drink it on the route back home. When he returned he was questioned about Qais by everyone in his, but he did not seem to remember anything, about his meeting with demon or Qais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There on he lived happily without even a thought of Qais, sighed happily, listened to the wind sweeping down from the mountains, to the chirping of the night birds. All thanks to the magic potion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the summary of a bedtime story narrated by father to his son and daughter from a book ‚ÄòAnd the Mountains Echoed‚Äô by Khaled Hosseini. Few of the names are not as same as they are in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
